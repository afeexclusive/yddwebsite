[Lesson from John 21:3-17] “So when they have dinned, Jesus said unto Simon Peter – Simon, son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these?” What made Jesus say this to Peter? Perhaps we should take it from the onset when he encountered Jesus. [Luke 5:4 –11] Having toiled all night, Peters fishing business was beginning to flop, Jesus came into the scene and intervened then Peter had a humongous profit- one at which he probably never had before for it was indeed net-breaking.</p>  <p> Seeing this he was afraid and was not sure if he was good enough for the Master. Jesus told him to fear not for He would make Peter fishers of men. That sounds like a good business deal. Peter seeing all that was done might have thought ‘why would I settle for this large temporary profit when I could ALWAYS have the source of unending wealth (referring to Jesus) with me. So Peter left all the fishes and followed Jesus, but we see Peter after a while still having the ‘what’s in it for me attitude’; he said something LIKE this to Jesus “boss, we have left all and followed You”. Jesus had to reassure him that whosoever has done that for His and the kingdom’s sake would receive reward here on earth and thereafter eternal life in heaven. Now the question is for whose sake did Peter leave all? For what purpose, why did he leave all? His initial motives as to this wasnt directly told us like that of Judas iscariot but Peter’s action told it all. </p>
<p>Peter now had the source of wealth with him he could miraculously pay for his tax and feed well, he was living the life; but when that source was taken away, what did we see Peter do? He went back to his primitive temporary inadequate source and it began to toil as in the days of old. God being merciful stepped into the situation again and this time, He revealed to Peter who Peter truly was.  </p> 


        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0">Peter was then asked “do you love me more than these?” i.e. do you genuinely love me for who I am and not for what I am or what I can provide, not for what I can do? After this, it was recorded that Peter was grieved, he remembered how he made claims and pledged to never leave/deny Jesus, he knew his one-sided love had been exposed; he was sorry.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>God in his infinite mercy is not willing that any should perish but that all should come unto repentance stepped into the situation again and proved his word which says ‘for without me you can do nothing.’ Peter along with his colleagues was told to fish on the right side (i would say the RIGHTeous side) and then closed a lot of fish so much that they were unable to draw it. This was a déjà vu and the orchestrator was recognised as before. Peter remembered why he previously left all because that same source is at play again.</p>

        <p>Peter initially was adamant in his beliefs, he wouldn’t easily allow Jesus to wash his feet, he rebuked Jesus (his source of wealth at that time) when Jesus spoke of His imminent travails and death. He was even dogmatic with his argument that he wouldn’t deny the master, but as soon as the master left, he went back to what his eyes was upon and this time, he tok some others with him.</p>

            It was an awesome time in God's presence yesterday at the singles' forum...God being merciful, He will always hear us, answer our prayers, grant our request in His own time, restore us… He will keep loving us. From henceforth, just love Him for who He is; for His love which He has showed to you.
